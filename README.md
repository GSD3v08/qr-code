## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned:
- that adding some padding to bottom of the main container in this case 'card' helps to always have a little space between the last element we add and the bottom of the box.
- how horizontal/vertical align works relative to viewport. 
- how rem & em units work.

Maybe these concepts are not so important but I'm just keep learning step by step.



### Continued development

- Keep using flexbox until I get used to it.
- Next challenges I will focus on how responsive works and try to implement in future designs.
